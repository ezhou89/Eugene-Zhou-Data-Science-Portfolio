<h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>
<p>I’ve recently been learning and practicing SQL, and given the fact that Google BigQuery is such a big deal now, I wanted to find a way to implement practice SQL by pulling from BigQuery’s public data sets and then visualizing in R.</p>
<p>Luckily, I found <a href="https://youtu.be/6j27h_17C1Q">this tutorial</a> on YouTube from John Little that acts as a tutorial/walk-through. We will be querying <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">JHU’s Covid19</a> public dataset for practice.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># Install packages if not already installed
#install.packages(c(&quot;DBI&quot;, &quot;bigrquery&quot;))
</code></pre>
<h2 id="lets-load-up-the-packages">Let’s load up the packages.</h2>
<pre><code class="language-r"># load tidymodels and tidyverse packages
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)

# bigrquery is a package to access BigQuery via R
library(bigrquery)

# DBI is a package that interfaces relational databases and R
library(DBI)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="establish-a-database-connection">Establish a database connection</h2>
<p>First create a new GCP project in the GCP. The <code>dbConnect()</code> argument, <code>billing</code>, should have the value of a GCP <strong>project ID</strong></p>
<p>GPC &gt; Home &gt; Dashboard GPC &gt; BigQuery</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">con &lt;- dbConnect(
  bigquery(),
  project = &quot;bigquery-public-data&quot;,
  dataset = &quot;covid19_jhu_csse&quot;,
  billing = &quot;fleet-furnace-316922&quot;
)
con
</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &lt;BigQueryConnection&gt;
##   Dataset: bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse
##   Billing: fleet-furnace-316922
</code></pre>
<p>Now, from <strong>within the R console</strong>, authenticate with GCP</p>
<pre><code>bigrquery::bq_auth()
</code></pre>
<h2 id="create-a-pointer-to-a-google-bq-database-table">Create a pointer to a Google BQ database table</h2>
<p>Here we query the JHU COVID19 data, specifically the summary table available in the BigQuery data (bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary), where <strong>summary</strong> after the name of the data set denotes the specific table in the relational database. While we receive a warning message about <code>bigrquery</code> and <code>dbplyr</code> being incompatible, the package and functions appear to still work. Let’s try to set <code>message=FALSE</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">my_db_pointer &lt;- tbl(con, &quot;summary&quot;)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: &lt;BigQueryConnection&gt; uses an old dbplyr interface
## ℹ Please install a newer version of the package or contact the maintainer
## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can use <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr verbs</a> to explore the db table. For example, the <code>glimpse()</code> function is fairly similar to the following SQL query:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT *
FROM bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary
LIMIT 10;
</code></pre>
<p>We see here that <code>glimpse()</code> returns all the variables or fields in the table, as well as the data type.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">glimpse(my_db_pointer) 
</code></pre>

<h2 id="using-dplyr-and-dbplyr">Using dplyr and dbplyr</h2>
<p><code>dplyr</code> can be used as a way to query data without needing to know SQL. <code>dbplyr</code> within the <code>dplyr</code> will be used to access data, and does not need to be called separate from the <code>tidyverse</code>.</p>
<p>First <em>connect to a table</em> using the <code>tbl()</code> function. This assumes you have already used <code>DBI::dbConnect()</code> to broker the database connection – as we did above.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">covid_data_DBplyr_style &lt;- tbl(con, &quot;summary&quot;) 
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: <code>collect()</code> will run a query that has been assigned to an object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>collect()</code> will activate your SQL query and store in local RAM.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># running collect on the list assigned to the variable will query the summary table from BigQuery

covid_data_DBplyr_style %&gt;% 
  collect()   # this will gather all the data from the summary table
</code></pre>
<p>Above will pull the entire data table down into local RAM. A better approach is to leverage dplyr. Let dplyr/dbplyr translate queries into SQL and send those to the SQL engine. This allows use to use the RDMBS for summarizing data while using local RAM and CPU for retrieving only the data you want to manipulate.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># we can use dplyr verbs here to clean the data using tidy principles which are then translated into a SQL query
